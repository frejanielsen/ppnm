#7 - Cholesky decomposition of a real symmetric positive-definite matrix



For a real symmetric positive-definite matrix, A, the Cholesky decomposition,
	A=LLT (where L is lower-triangular), is more efficient than the LU-decomposition. 
	Read the book and/or Wikipedia article Cholesky-decomposition.

Implement Cholesky decomposition of a real symmetric positive-definite matrix using
	 Cholesky-Banachiewicz or Cholesky-Crout algorithms.

For more points implement also the corresponding linear equation solver, 
	calculation of determinant, and calculation of the inverse matrix.
