#7 - Cholesky decomposition of a real symmetric positive-definite matrix

A real symmetric positive-definite matrix, A, has been factorized using Cholesky
decomposition. The matrix L, for which A=LL^T, has in my program been 
determined using 




Implement Cholesky decomposition of a real symmetric positive-definite matrix using
	 Cholesky-Banachiewicz or Cholesky-Crout algorithms.

For more points implement also the corresponding linear equation solver, 
	calculation of determinant, and calculation of the inverse matrix.
